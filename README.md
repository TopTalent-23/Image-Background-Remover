# Image Background Remover

A web application that removes backgrounds from images using a Next.js frontend and Flask backend. Upload single or multiple images and download the processed results with transparent backgrounds.


This application uses the [rembg](https://pypi.org/project/rembg/) model for background removal. Rembg is an open-source tool that uses deep learning to remove image backgrounds.

## Features

- Upload multiple images simultaneously
- Real-time processing progress tracking
- Download individual processed images or all as a zip file
- Responsive design with image previews
- Processing time display for each image

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 15
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI Components

### Backend
- Python Flask
- rembg (Background Removal Library) - Uses U2NET model for background removal
- TensorFlow (Required by rembg)

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Permission denied errors:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker system prune -f
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Backend not accessible:
   - Check if the backend container is running: `docker-compose ps`
   - Verify network connectivity between containers
   - Check backend logs: `docker-compose logs backend`

3. Images not processing:
   - Ensure enough system resources are available
   - Check backend logs for Python errors
   - Verify file size and format compatibility
